# Company-Organizer-learning-classes
- Simple code that's based off user input to add or remove interns and employees to a company's team<br>
- can set a max number of each group
- Once you're finished, you can save all the data to a .txt file for later use
- Nothing crazy but this was more to learn the basics of classes, file use, and some error-checking
